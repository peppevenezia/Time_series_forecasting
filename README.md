# Time_series_forecasting


The goal of this competition was to build a forecasting model
that predicted the future trends of a multivariate time series
by exploiting the past observations. The available dataset was
composed of 7 time-series, each composed of 68528 samples.
The hidden test sequence consisted of 864 future values which
had to be forecasted, providing the prediction for each time
step.
